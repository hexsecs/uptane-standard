## Reporting Errata


Please report (suspected) errata in the specification to `uptane-security [AT] googlegroups [DOT] com`. You will receive an acknowledgement from us within 72 hours. Keep in mind that Uptane is a community based project of volunteers and, therefore, response times could vary. If the issue is confirmed, we will provide a response within 90 days.

## Guidelines

We're committed to working with security researchers to resolve errata they discover. You can help us by following these guidelines:

*   Report errata to our dedicated security email (see [Reporting Errata](#reporting-errata))
*   Please give as much detail as possible for a suspected errata in Uptane including:
     *  Version found
     *  Description of errata
     *  Examples (if applicable)
*   Be patient - Give us a reasonable time to correct the issue before you disclose the errata. We care deeply about security, however we're an open-source project and our team is mostly comprised of volunteers.
*   We are committed to acknowledging the contributions of security researchers (if desired)
*   If you have found a vulnerability related to a certain vendor's implementaiton of the Uptane standard, please report directly to that solution provider
