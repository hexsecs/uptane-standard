## Guidelines

We're committed to working with security researchers to resolve the vulnerabilities they discover. You can help us by following these guidelines:

*   Please give as much detail as possible for a suspected vulnerability in Uptane including:
     *  Version found
     *  Description of vulnerability
     *  Examples (if applicable)
*   Be patient - Give us a reasonable time to correct the issue before you disclose the vulnerability. We care deeply about security, but we're an open-source project and our team is mostly comprised of volunteers.
*   We are committed to acknowledging the contributions of security researchers (if desired)
